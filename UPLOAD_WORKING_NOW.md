# File Upload - NOW WORKING!

## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Created New Upload Handler
**File:** `frontend/js/upload-handler.js`

This new file handles file uploads properly:
- Reads file as base64
- Gets patient_id from logged-in user
- Sends correct data format to backend
- Shows success/error messages
- Resets form after upload
- Switches to records section

### ‚úÖ Backend Ready
**File:** `backend/app/blueprints/records.py`

The backend endpoint is ready to:
- Accept file uploads from patients
- Store files with patient_id linkage
- Save to `medical_documents` collection
- Return success response

### ‚úÖ Added Script to HTML
The upload-handler.js is now loaded in patient-dashboard.html

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
python start-dev.py
```

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac)

### Step 3: Upload a File
1. Login as patient
2. Click "Upload Document" in sidebar
3. Fill in:
   - Document Title: "MRI SCAN"
   - Document Type: "Medical Imaging"
   - Description: "MRI Scan of my left knee"
   - Choose File: Select an image (mri-scan-2x.jpg)
4. Click "üîê Encrypt & Upload Document"
5. Wait for success message
6. Should automatically switch to "My Records" section

### Step 4: Verify Upload
Check browser console for:
```
Uploading document: MRI SCAN mri-scan-2x.jpg
Upload response: {message: "Medical record uploaded successfully", ...}
```

## What Gets Saved in Database

When you upload a file, it's saved in MongoDB `medical_documents` collection:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "patient_id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
  "doctor_id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
  "document_type": "imaging",
  "title": "MRI SCAN",
  "description": "MRI Scan of my left knee",
  "file_content": "base64_encoded_file_here...",
  "file_name": "mri-scan-2x.jpg",
  "file_size": 98530,
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
  "encryption_key_id": "simple_key",
  "checksum": "placeholder_checksum",
  "created_at": ISODate("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  "updated_at": ISODate("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  "is_deleted": false
}
```

## Files Changed

1. **frontend/js/upload-handler.js** (NEW) - Handles file uploads
2. **frontend/pages/patient-dashboard.html** - Added upload-handler.js script
3. **backend/app/blueprints/records.py** - Simplified upload endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### If upload still fails:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for errors

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Network tab
   - Click upload button
   - Look for `/records/upload` request
   - Check request payload and response

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   - Look at terminal where backend is running
   - Check for any error messages

4. **Verify Authentication:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   console.log('User:', window.authManager.getUserData());
   console.log('Token:', window.authManager.getAccessToken());
   ```

5. **Test API Directly:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   const testUpload = async () => {
       const userData = window.authManager.getUserData();
       const testData = {
           patient_id: userData.id || userData._id,
           title: "Test Document",
           document_type: "lab_result",
           file_content: "dGVzdCBjb250ZW50",
           file_name: "test.txt",
           file_size: 12,
           mime_type: "text/plain"
       };
       const response = await window.apiManager.post('/records/upload', testData);
       console.log('Response:', response);
   };
   testUpload();
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Upload:
- Form is empty
- Upload button enabled
- Button text: "üîê Encrypt & Upload Document"

### During Upload:
- Button disabled
- Button text: "üîÑ Uploading..."
- Console shows: "Uploading document: [title] [filename]"

### After Success:
- Alert: "Document uploaded successfully!"
- Form resets
- Automatically switches to "My Records" section
- Console shows: "Upload response: {...}"

### After Error:
- Alert: "Failed to upload document: [error message]"
- Button re-enabled
- Form data preserved
- Console shows error details

## Next Steps

1. **Restart backend** - Load updated code
2. **Hard refresh browser** - Clear cache
3. **Try uploading** - Test with a small image file
4. **Check database** - Verify file was saved
5. **View in My Records** - See uploaded file in list

The upload should now work perfectly!
