# Patient Dashboard Navigation Fix

## Problem
The navigation links were highlighted (active) but the sections weren't showing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Inline onclick Handlers
Updated the sidebar navigation links to include direct onclick handlers:

```html
<a href="#upload" class="nav-link" data-section="upload" 
   onclick="window.switchSection('upload'); return false;">
   ðŸ“¤ Upload Document
</a>
```

This ensures navigation works even if event listeners fail to attach.

### 2. Created Backup Navigation Function
Added `window.switchSection()` function that:
- Directly manipulates DOM classes
- Doesn't depend on the dashboard object
- Works immediately on page load
- Has detailed console logging

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added console logs to track:
- When functions are called
- Which sections are being switched
- If sections are found or not
- Navigation state changes

## How to Test

### Step 1: Hard Refresh
Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to clear cache

### Step 2: Open Console
Press **F12** and go to Console tab

### Step 3: Click Navigation Links
Click each link and watch the console:
- "Dashboard" â†’ Should show dashboard section
- "My Records" â†’ Should show records section
- "Upload Document" â†’ Should show upload form
- "Access Control" â†’ Should show access control
- "Profile" â†’ Should show profile section

### Step 4: Verify in Console
You should see messages like:
```
Direct switch to: upload
Section shown: upload
```

## Manual Testing

If navigation still doesn't work, run this in console:

```javascript
// Test each section manually
window.switchSection('dashboard')
window.switchSection('records')
window.switchSection('upload')
window.switchSection('access')
window.switchSection('profile')
```

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **frontend/pages/patient-dashboard.html**
   - Added onclick handlers to all nav links
   - Keeps existing data-section attributes

2. **frontend/js/patient-dashboard.js**
   - Added `window.switchSection()` function
   - Enhanced logging in existing functions
   - Better error messages

## Why This Works

The onclick handler provides a **direct, immediate** way to switch sections that:
- Doesn't wait for event listeners
- Doesn't depend on initialization order
- Works even if JavaScript has errors
- Provides instant feedback in console

## Troubleshooting

### If sections still don't show:

1. **Check Console for Errors**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check if "Section not found" appears

2. **Verify Section IDs**
   Run in console:
   ```javascript
   ['dashboard', 'records', 'upload', 'access', 'profile'].forEach(id => {
     console.log(id, document.getElementById(id) ? 'âœ“' : 'âœ—');
   });
   ```

3. **Check CSS**
   Run in console:
   ```javascript
   const upload = document.getElementById('upload');
   console.log('Display:', window.getComputedStyle(upload).display);
   console.log('Classes:', upload.className);
   ```

4. **Force Show Section**
   Run in console:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('upload').style.display = 'block';
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Click:
- Dashboard section visible (has `active` class)
- Other sections hidden (no `active` class)
- Dashboard link highlighted

### After Clicking "Upload Document":
- Dashboard section hidden (no `active` class)
- Upload section visible (has `active` class)
- Upload link highlighted
- Console shows: "Direct switch to: upload"

## Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh** your browser
2. **Click "Upload Document"** in sidebar
3. **Check console** for messages
4. **Report** what you see in console

The navigation should now work immediately!
